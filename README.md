# guess-the-number
A simple console-based "Guess the Number" game where the player guesses a randomly generated number. The game provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low, and counts the number of attempts until the player guesses correctly. Ideal for beginners to practice Python concepts like loops, conditionals, and random number generation.
